Reporting bugs
--------------

- **Is it a security vulnerability? Please do <ins>not</ins> open an issue and instead review our [security policy](https://github.com/StarbaseCommunityProject/EndoLink/security/policy)!**
- Ensure the bug hasn't already been reported by searching through our [issues](https://github.com/StarbaseCommunityProject/EndoLink/issues?q=label%3Abug). 
- If the bug hasn't been reported yet, please open a [bug report issue](https://github.com/StarbaseCommunityProject/EndoLink/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).
- If possible, include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
- If you're not using Docker to run the website; please make sure the bug also occurs there.

Are you looking for an issue to work on?
----------------------------------------

- Please check the [Project Board's](https://github.com/orgs/StarbaseCommunityProject/projects/1) Backlog for any new features that need work.
- If there is no feature for what you want to work on in the Backlog, please discuss the option of adding it with the rest of the team. Consider reviewing the list of potential future features and see if it falls under one of those.
- If someone is already working on a feature you're interested in; consider asking them if they need help.


How to work on issues
---------------------
We follow [github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). Our Main branch is always a stable production release, while Development is actively used for branching off of.

Once all features for a release are done, we'll switch over to only accepting bug fix pull requests for a designated time. Once this is done, we merge Development into Main and deploy this new version of the website.

- When starting on a new feature or bug fix; make a new branch off of Development and give it a **clear** name.
- Consider adding tests for your feature.
- For larger or more complex features; please document them and consider adding information to the README if applicable.
- Once done, open a pull request to merge into the Development branch.
  - This pull request will be reviewed and accepted if everything checks out.
  - You'll need at least 1 other member of the team to sign off on your pull request before it can be merged. You can request a review in the pull request, or contact someone on Discord to have it be reviewed.
